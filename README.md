# Fake-News-Detection
## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news by classifying news articles as either "fake" or "true." Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the project preprocesses text data, extracts features, and trains several classifiers to identify fake news accurately.

## Data
The dataset consists of two CSV files:

#### Fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.
#### True.csv: Contains true news articles.
Each article includes a title, text, subject, and date. A "class" column is introduced to label fake news as 0 and true news as 1.
